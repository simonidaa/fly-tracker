# Fly Tracker

Fly Tracker is a system designed for tracking the interactions of Drosophila (fruit flies) with and without fragile X chromosome. The system is based on a novel algorithm that uses machine learning techniques to track the flies and analyze their behavior.

The system is particularly useful for researchers studying the genetics and behavior of fruit flies. By tracking the interactions of individual flies, researchers can gain insights into their social behavior and the effects of genetic mutations.

## Features

- Novel algorithm based on the Hungarian algorithm for tracking fly interactions
- Object tracking using OpenCV computer vision library
- Automated selection of model parameters
- Visualization of tracking results

The Fly Tracker system utilizes the Hungarian algorithm for assigning fly identities in each frame of the video. It also uses the OpenCV computer vision library for object tracking, allowing for accurate tracking of fly movement and behavior.
